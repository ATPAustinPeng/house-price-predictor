## Introduction/Background

​	Various factors affect the prices of houses in any location. Without a proper way to determine the effect of those factors, it is not possible to find out the best time to buy a house, which is obviously at the lowest value possible within a certain time frame. Many studies have been done, both on the analysis of housing factors and long-term changes. There have been cases of “bubbles'' in the short term where the housing prices increase faster than income and then collapse (Kahn). When we start looking at the bigger picture, over a few hundred years, there are shifts in the importance of housing factors such as construction costs before 1900 to population count after World War II (Martijn, Minne). Combining both these short-term and long-term factors with machine learning would yield both better predictive capability and detailed insight.

## Problem Definition

​	What long-term and short-term factors converge at the lowest price and what does this forecast for the current and future housing market?

## Methods

​	Previous studies have shown that Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine utilizing MSE, RMSE, and MAPE have been the best metrics in the analysis of housing data (Ho, Tang, Wo). Combining these estimators with other metrics from factors that impact housing prices would yield the best results. This could include data such as economic information and labor costs for long-term effects or quarterly micro-inflation and domestic conflicts (wars, bombings, etc.) for the short term. Combining our information with factors we learn in class, such as decision trees, linear regression, and entropy will allow us to create the most efficient and informative predictive model to optimize house price predictions.

## Potential Results And Discussion

​	There could be multiple interesting results that arise when we combine both long-term and short-term factors. For example, predictions that the housing market would crash during Covid were proven wrong when results arose that housing prices were resilient to pandemics (Grybauskas, Pilinkiene, Stundziene). Combining anomalies like this into our analysis would allow us to have a more effective model. We believe the results will be unexpected since the current time period is unique, given that we are not necessarily post-pandemic but businesses are still returning to normal with the economy's highest inflation rates since The Great Depression.
